# jacoco4sbt - Code Coverage via JaCoCo in sbt

This is an [sbt](http://scala-sbt.org/) and [Typesafe Activator](https://typesafe.com/activator) plugin for code coverage analysis via [JaCoCo](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/).

Install the plugin by adding the following to `project/plugins.sbt`:

    addSbtPlugin("de.johoop" % "jacoco4sbt" % "2.2.0")

and then in `build.sbt`:

    jacoco.settings

Execute the plugin with `sbt jacoco:cover`.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/sbt/jacoco4sbt/wiki) for more details.
